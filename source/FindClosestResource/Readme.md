#Find Closest Facility Map Tool

Find the closest facility map tool identifies closest facilities from given incidents and returns the best routes to identified facilities.  This addin is built as a Map Tool with a Toolbar for the [Operations Dashboard for ArcGIS](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/operations-dashboard/).  The addin can be added as a Map Tool on a Map Widget.  No data is required to run the tool.
