# Buffer Features Map Tool

The Buffer map tool generates buffers at specified distance and rings.  This addin is built as a Map Tool with a Toolbar for the [Operations Dashboard for ArcGIS](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/operations-dashboard/).  The addin can be added as a Map Tool on a Map Widget.  No data is required to run the tool.
